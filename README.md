## Steps :
Here's a step-by-step guide to understanding the repository:

### 1. Importing Libraries :
We begin by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### 2. Reading the Data :
We load the dataset named 'final dataset.csv' using pandas and display the first few rows to get an overview of the data.

### 3. Understanding the Data :
We explore the dataset's properties such as data types, shape, size, columns, maximum, minimum, and statistical summary.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
We visualize the data using various plots, including bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, and more, to gain insights into its characteristics.

### 5. Missing Data Handling :
We address missing values in the dataset using techniques like imputation. The progress of this step is shown.

### 6. Data Preprocessing :
We split the data into dependent and independent variables for model training and apply feature scaling.

### 7. Model Training :
We use several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to predict water quality.

### 8. Model Evaluation :
We evaluate the trained models' accuracy using confusion matrices and provide the accuracy score.

### 9. Model Comparison :
We compare the accuracy scores of different models to identify the best-performing one.

## Results :
After comparing various models, the **Random Forest Classifier** stands out with the highest accuracy score of **78.66%**.
