# Data Collection for The Water Portability Project

In the **Water Portability Project**, one of the crucial aspects is the comprehensive collection of data from various sources within the Churu district of Rajasthan, India. This README file outlines the methodology and hypothetical divisions utilized for data collection purposes. It is important to emphasize that these divisions are solely for illustrative purposes and are not official government designations. For accurate and official administrative divisions, it is recommended to refer to the latest government records and publications.
